# Algorithm Visualization

This is a web-based application that lets you visualize how different sorting algorithms work. You can select an algorithm from the dropdown, generate a random set of bars, and watch as the bars move around to get sorted.

## Algorithms Included

The app supports the following sorting algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: An algorithm that works by iterating through an array, removing one element at a time, and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion.
- **Selection Sort**: An algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part.
- **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the input array into two halves, calling itself for the two halves, and then merging the two sorted halves.
- **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting technique based on the binary heap data structure. It's one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, with a time complexity of O(n log n).
